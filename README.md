# Andrew's-Portfolio

#Description
This project is a website that contains information about me and the works i have created. It is simultaneously a demonstration of my skills as well as a hub for my projects. I aim to constantly improve this website over time as i learn more and more. I hope to one day have a fully fletched website looking exactly how i want.

#Installation

#Usage
This website can be used by potential employers to view my work as a hiring candidate and see the different skills that i have applied and mastered. The website demonstrates my capabilities to the potential hire manager and demonstrates my skills and small biography to anyone else viewing the page. The page should allow the user to familiarize themselve with me and get to know me.
